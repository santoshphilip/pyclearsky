Notes on moving to uv from (and running with uv) https://x.com/i/grok?conversation=2002198771770290596


Moving to uv
============

    uv init
    uv add -r requirements.txt
    uv add --dev -r requirements_dev.txt
    uv sync

Running on uv
=============

    uv run python your_script.py
    uv run pytest                      # If you have tests
    uv run ruff check .                # If you added ruff as a dev tool


Updating on uv
==============

    uv lock --upgrade     # Update all packages to latest compatible versions
    uv sync               # Apply the updates to the environment

    uv add --dev ruff mypy pytest
    uv add requests
    
    uv run pip install ipython # for internal dev
                               # no need to publish in .toml
    
bumping a version and pushing branch and pushing tags
=====================================================
  
::  

    uv version --bump patch/minor/major

    git commit -m "Bump version to $(uv version --short)"
    git tag "v$(uv version --short)"
    git push origin <branch>
    git push origin tag "v$(uv version --short)"

Now publish
===========

::
  
    uv build
    uv publish --token # token comes here



Lists of files changing when uv is used
=======================================

files changed::

    .github/workflows/tests.yml # for github actions
    pyclearsky/__init__.py # version is got from pyproject.toml
    docs/requirements.txt # needed for readthedocs
    pyproject.toml # uv likes having everything here

Once uv is set upthese files can be removed::

    requirements.txt
    requirements_dev.txt
    setup.cfg
    setup.py


Webhooks from github to readthdocs
==================================

- login to readthedocs using github
- copy webhooks and secret from readthedocs to github

python3 -m venv ~/venvs/py3pyclearsky
source ~/venvs/py3pyclearsky/bin/activate

# other times
source ~/venvs/py3pyclearsky/bin/activate

How to run twine

= git commit
- make clean
- bumpversion patch # or minor or major

Create some distributions in the normal way:

    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

Upload with twine to Test PyPI and verify things look right. Twine will automatically prompt for your username and password:

    twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
    username: ...
    password:


Upload to PyPI:

    twine upload dist/*

Done!

----------
- Do travis  DONE
- Readthedocs is building everytime I push - Need to change this
- updating pypi is not working right now.
    - the long description was broken simply because the short description was too long

2018-04-18
----------

using bumpversion
- bumpversion --current-version 0.1.0 minor # becomes 0.2.0
- bumpversion --current-version 0.2.0 patch # becomes 0.2.1
files changed are:
- pyclearsky/__init__.py
- setup.py
- setup.cfg
it will also commit changes with a bump version message


2018-04-16
----------

Got the API documentation figured out. From
https://samnicholls.net/2016/06/15/how-to-sphinx-readthedocs/

Study and act on functionality in coockiecutter
- documentation
    - need stephen's help in
- clean up tests
    - pytest
        - fuck ... tests are failing. I'll have to review all, carefully
    - try to generate documentation.
    - what is pytest-runner
    - see test coverage

2018-04-01
----------
quickest effect:
- add documentation
- do a full release to pypi
- to read the docs


2018-03-23
----------

cookiecutter uses .editorconfig # http://editorconfig.org
textmate plugin is: https://github.com/Mr0grog/editorconfig-textmate


read up on:
https://cookiecutter-pypackage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
to make full use of cookiecutter
- bumpversion -> bumps up the version of the release software
- autorelease to pypi when there is a new tag on master
- pyup will keep the dependencies updated -> mya want to use the local version
- will run Travis-Cl
- will add the repo to read the docs account

uploaded to pypi - DONE
- see online documentation for how to do this.
- pypi is a fast changing env. -> will have to scramble to do this again.

Next steps
- click package
- test for click
- documentation
    - "make html" generates the html documentation
    - html is in docs/_build/html/index.html
    - docs/_build in in gitignore
- __doc__ documentation
- Readme
- check on contributions.md
- tests
